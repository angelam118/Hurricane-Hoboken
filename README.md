# Hurricane-Hoboken

**Period:** 7

**Description:**

We are creating a game similar to the Oregon Trail called Hurricane Hoboken. The user will navigate through the Hudson River, trying to get from New Jersey to Stuy. They will encounter obstacles that will take them into mini-games. They must reach the end before the hurricane approaches; otherwise, they die. The mini-games will include a game where they have to dig out of a sand bank, one where they escape a shark, and one where they avoid the propellers of a boat.
